# [NoKunda] (www.nokunda.com)

NoKunda Mobile app is designed to Report Electricity theft happening in **Pakistan**. The Scope and relevance of Nokunda is tremendous in our Country considering the prevalent Energy crises and Lack of Infrastructure/Resources to resolve power losses or mitigate them.  Nokunda invests in the power of people, to report widespread Electricity theft and bringing perpetrators to justice.  We want to report Electricity theft and resolve the Losses incurred by using *Crowdsourcing*, i-e Putting People in charge.

Nokunda has a Publically accessible & dynamically updating **Heat** map of Electricity theft reports consolidating from all over Pakistan. Anyone anywhere can report a Kunda Using the Smart Phone application, and that Report will be displayed on a Publically accessible website with precise Geo-location Data and High Resolution image. We have structured the process of reporting in a way that is Anonymous so that people are motivated to report electricity theft without any fear.

###Problem Solving Approach
---

Electricity theft is a massive problem plaguing our grid infrastructure and Electricity distribution system. There are no systems in place to detect or report electricity theft happening either on Domestic Consumer side or by Industries. With lack of Infrastructure or Resources to resolve such a prevalent problem, utility companies have no choice but to put the load on the consumers in the form of Load shedding. Electricity theft is not only a crime but it also affects the whole system in the form of default on payments and generating unmanageable losses. 
 With Nokunda we came up with a solution that is easy to deploy but also powerful in solving the problem.  We made a smartphone App and invested on the idea of crowdsourcing, by making people incharge of reporting power theft and resolving the problem. Anyone anywhere can download our mobile app and Report a Kunda or Tampered Meter near his locality. That Report With its Image and Location data is sent to a backend database, which Displays it on a publically accessible map. What we are trying to promote is make people in charge and promote civic responsibility in resolving our own problems. Similarly utility companies can employ the same solution and dedicate a team for collection and reporting Electricity theft. And the whole operation would be transparent with a public accessible map, where consumer would know whether their utility company is doing something about Electricity theft or not.

###Potential
---
With Nokunda we want to solve the energy crises in Pakistan. With Crowdsourcing we want to set a trend where everyone who uses electricity should consider it his duty to report and resolve the issue of theft present in our system. Moreover we have gamified the experience of Reporting via social sharing where anyone reporting a Kunda will share it with his friends that he is a responsible citizen and he just uploaded a kunda Report. This gamification process will motivate his friends to do the same, we want to make it a social movement where anyone having a smartphone should Report at least one Kunda picture and nominate three friends to do the same. Moreover if the process of Kunda reporting is further incentivized then more and more people will be motivated to report kundas.
